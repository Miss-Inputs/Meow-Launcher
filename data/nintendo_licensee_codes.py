nintendo_licensee_codes = {
	#Big list! Used in every Nintendo system except: NES (but FDS does use it), N64 (but 64DD does use it), e-Reader, and depending on who you ask Pokemon Mini either has 2P for every game (i.e. if you ask me) or it doesn't use this. Well, I presume Switch does in some way; 3DS seems to be a bit weird, and Wii U uses 4 characters so I guess they ran out of codes with all the indie publishers (most just use this list prepended with 00)
	#Preferred format that I probably don't always use consistently:
	#Company without Co, Inc, Ltd, etc
	#Company (Brand name used by company)
	#Company A / Company B which purchased A or A otherwise got absorbed into
	#Company A / New name of Company A

	#Mostly verified, just that companies buy each other out and change their names and things just to personally annoy me, so these are a bit weird and dependent on what year it is
	'4F': 'U.S. Gold/Eidos', #Eidos purchased U.S. Gold in 1996; also this appears in the Gauntlet DS proto, but that wasn't going to be published by Eidos nor did they develop it
	'4Q': 'Disney/Buena Vista Interactive', #What's maximum spooky is that this also shows up in the Spiderman: Friend or Foe trailer, but that was 2007 and Disney hadn't purchased Marvel yet. Disney Interactive Studios spun off Buena Vista Interactive from 2003 to 2007 but that still doesn't explain Spiderman. It's not in any of the other DS downloadable videos. What the crap?
	'54': 'GameTek/Take-Two Interactive/Global Star Software', #Oof this one's a really fun one. Some documentation says "Konami/GameTek" which is just garbage because Konami has nothing to do with this, but some older games using this code like Wheel of Fortune on SNES and the InfoGenius Productivity Pak on GB are indeed published under GameTek. Where it gets fun is that GameTek became Take-Two Interactive at some point, and Duke Nukem Advance uses this code too and was published under the Take-Two Interactive name.. but then Dora the Explorer: Dora's World Adventures also uses this code but was published under Global Star Software, which was a company that became 2K Play which is then a branch of 2K Games and if you've lost track of everything I don't blame you and I just spent several tens of minutes googling around for info on Dora the Explorer why do I do this to myself
	#Anyway this one just seems to cover everything that's owned by Take-Two Interactive, maybe... 9G has all that too except GameTek, so maybe then this is GameTek
	'5D': 'Midway/Tradewest/Williams', #For all intents and purposes starts off as Bally Midway (it doesn't, but let's not care about pre-1969), purchased by Williams in 1988 (but as "Bally/Midway"), albeit in 1991 started using the name Midway alone, then in 1996 some screwy stuff happened involving WMS and Time Warner, becomes independent in 1998 (but keeps the subsidiary known as "Atari Games" just to confuse me further until 2000) and then now they're sold to Warner Bros and then there's Tradeswest in there somewhere but only up to 1994? Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
	'70': 'Infogrames/Atari, SA', #Infogrames renamed itself to Atari or purchased the brand name or something in 2003 because they could, but are otherwise unrelated to the OG Atari, also purchased and sold off all sorts of companies along the way (e.g. GT Interactive in 1999, Hasbro Interactive in 2001)
	'7D': 'Vivendi/Sierra', #This is weird, because Sierra was merged with Activision in 2010, who at the time were owned by Vivendi, but now they aren't and then they revived the Sierra brand name in 2014. So that's confusing. One of these boxes I have lying around containing a game with this licensee code says Sierra on it, and that was... 2008? So I dunno
	'99': 'Pack-in Video/Victor Interactive/Marvelous Interactive', #Merged with Victor in 1997 and then with Marvelous in 2003, so Victor and Marvelous probably used different codes before then (or weren't involved with Nintendo)
	'AF': 'Namco/Bandai Namco', #Namco games have always used this, but when they merged with Bandai (Sep 2005), they kept this code, which is interesting because Square Enix doesn't reuse Squaresoft or Enix's licensee codes and gets a new one
	'CE': 'Pony Canyon/FCI', #Seems to be Fujisankei Communications International (as FCI Inc) for USA releases, Pony Canyon for Japanese releases, both are owned by Fujisankei Communications Group
	'5Z': 'Conspiracy Entertainment / Swing Entertainment', #Hmm I don't know the particular connection with these two companies but they definitely both use 5Z

	#So far, only seen once so it might be wrong or inaccurate, hopefully not
