	#Some arcade games that have names that are too common, there are home games with the same name that aren't necessarily related other than the same franchise potentially, and it's better to avoid messing around there since this whole find_equivalent_arcade_games thing is mostly a hack to see if we can get nice icons and genres for things

	'term2', #There are home ports of this (Terminator 2: Judgement Day), but they are called "T2: The Arcade Game" to avoid confusion with the unrelated tie ins which aren't conversions of the arcade which are called "Terminator 2: Judgement Day", even though that doesn't avoid confusion at all and merely creates it. Anyway, there are probably ways I could handle this case, but I don't feel like doing them for now.
