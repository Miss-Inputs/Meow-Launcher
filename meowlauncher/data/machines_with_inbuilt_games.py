# Too many machines with inbuilt functionality that doesn't seem like a great idea to add
# BASIC: Acorn Electron, Amstrad CPC, Acorn Atom, Alice 32, SVI-3x8, ZX81, Videoton TVC etc
# Memory card management: PlayStation, Mega CD, Neo Geo CD, Saturn

# Warning messages
# BBC Bridge Companion
# Mattel HyperScan

# Non-game stuff that I guess I could put in here
# Acorn Archimedes: RISC OS 3.0.0, some apps
# Game Pocket Computer: Spirally test pattern
# Mattel Juice Box: Trailers
# Neo Geo Pocket: Calendar / horoscope
# V.Smile Baby: Learn and Discovery Home (whatever that does)
# Amiga / logica2: Logica Diagnostics #but which Amiga?

# Needs autoboot script:
# sms1 / bios13: Press Up + 1 + 2 to access Snail Maze
# RCA Studio 2: Bowling + Freeway + Patterns + Doodles + Math (this requires pressing F3 and then some number)

# Could really do with an autoboot script:
# Game.com: Solitaire + phone book + calculator + calendar
# VideoBrain: Text/colour/clock/alarm selectable by F1/F2/F3/F4
# V.Tech Socrates: Various maths/word games, "Super Paint"

# Buzztime Home Trivia System: Everything Trivia, but this is in the software list? Doesn't work anyway
# Vii, ekara could go in here if we need to make them systems to make their software list business work
# Gachinko Contest! Slot Machine TV: I dunno the game because it's written in kanji
