Other controllers: Miracle Piano (same as NES?)
Stuff not available as MAME slot device so it wuoldn't appear in software lists so we have no way of getting that information I guessâ€¦ wait we don't get that information anyway: That horse racing numpad thingo
Barcode Battler goes in the controller slot but from what I can tell it's not really a controller?
