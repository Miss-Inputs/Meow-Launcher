This should go in the readme, but since I don't know where I'm going with anything right now, I'll just mention it here

Gonna use stuff that's new to Python 3.7 so no trying to run this on an OS you haven't upgraded in 10 years or whatever

Stuff that is called by subprocess:
7z (did I make this optional? I guess it can't be)
butler (from itch.io desktop app, if using itch.io)
mame (gotta make sure this is optional for those only using normal ROMs and not arcade stuff)
scummvm (if using it)
stella (for Atari 2600, should be optional)
hactool or nstool (for Switch, should be optional)

Files that might be installed that we can use:
libretro-database (as an option)
MAME history.dat, catlist.ini, series.ini, languages.ini, bestgames.ini, version.ini (the paths are taken from mame.ini/ui.ini, all should be optional though catlist is a good idea to have)
GameTDB (as an option)
mupen64plus.ini (for N64, optional)
